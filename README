nickle
------------------------------------------
Nickle is a programming language based prototyping environment with 
powerful programming and scripting capabilities. Nickle supports a 
variety of datatypes, especially arbitrary precision numbers. The 
programming language vaguely resembles C. Some things in C which do not 
translate easily are different, some design choices have been made 
differently, and a very few features are simply missing.

WARNING:
Due to Cygwin limitations, any I/O operations involving file descriptors 
(including terminal I/O) causes the nickle interpreter to hang. This is 
a known issue and will only be fixed when Cygwin provides the requisite 
functionality(O_ASYNC or I_SETSIG), or a patch is provided for 
nickle/file.c to not use asynchronous I/O.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-1.7.1-1
  libgcc1-4.3.4-3
  libreadline7-6.0.3-2

Build requirements:

Build instructions:
  unpack nickle-2.69-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./nickle-2.69-X.cygport all

This will create:
