ldesc: "Nickle is a programming language based prototyping environment 
with powerful programming and scripting capabilities. Nickle supports a 
variety of datatypes, especially arbitrary precision numbers. The 
programming language vaguely resembles C. Some things in C which do not 
translate easily are different, some design choices have been made 
differently, and a very few features are simply missing."
